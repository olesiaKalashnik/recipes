 Spinach Mushroom Quiche

Ingredients

1 prepared 9-inch single pie crust
4 eggs
3/4 cup milk
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 (10 ounce) bag fresh spinach
1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
1/2 yellow onion, sliced
1/2 (4 ounce) container crumbled feta cheese
1/2 (8 ounce) package shredded Swiss cheese, divided

Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Fit pie crust into a 9-inch pie dish.
3. Whisk eggs, milk, parsley, garlic, salt, black pepper, and nutmeg in a bowl.
4. Gently combine spinach, mushrooms, onion, and feta cheese in a separate bowl. Spread spinach-mushroom mixture in the prepared pie dish; top with half the Swiss cheese.
5. Pour egg mixture evenly over the filling, swirling egg mixture in bowl to spread seasonings through the eggs; top the quiche with remaining Swiss cheese. Place quiche on a baking sheet.
6. Bake in preheated oven until the quiche is lightly puffed and browned, 45 to 50 minutes. A toothpick inserted into the center of the filling should come out clean. Cool for 30 minutes before serving.

Tip: Aluminum foil can be used to keep food moist, cook it evenly, and make clean-up easier.
